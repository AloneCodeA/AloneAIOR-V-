# AloneAIOR-Public
 AloneAIOR is an automated game control system for the popular game TalesRunner. This project aims to provide a fully automated experience by leveraging various Windows API calls and custom routines to interact with the game window, simulate user inputs, capture screen data, and automate in-game actions.
 
The repository includes modules for:

Window and process control for managing and interacting with the game client.

Image processing and pixel detection for tracking in-game state and executing context-specific actions.

Keyboard and mouse input automation to simulate complex sequences of in-game commands.

Game-specific task automation, such as jumping, dashing, and managing character interactions.

The solution is built in C# and makes use of WinAPI for seamless control of the game environment.

Whether you want to automate tedious tasks, create bots for practice, or just experiment with automating game control, AloneAIOR is a great starting point. Contributions and suggestions for improvements are always welcome!

Note: This project is intended for educational purposes. Please check the game's terms of service before using any automated tools to avoid any potential violations.
